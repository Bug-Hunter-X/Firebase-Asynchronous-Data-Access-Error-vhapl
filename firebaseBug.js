The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded. This can happen if you're using asynchronous functions without properly handling promises or async/await.  For example, if you call `.data()` on a snapshot inside an asynchronous function before the `.get()` operation has completed, you might get `undefined` or an error.
